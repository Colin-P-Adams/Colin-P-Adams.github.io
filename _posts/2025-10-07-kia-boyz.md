<a href="https://x.com/JohnArnoldFndtn"> John Arnold</a> recently highlighted the figure below from one of<a href="https://jasher.substack.com/p/re-evaluating-washington-dcs-crime?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=email&triedRedirect=true"> Jeff Asher</a>'s substack posts. This got me thinking of how viral trends from TikTok or other platforms may create exogenous variation which can be exploited for causal inference.

All US market Kias manufactured from 2011 to 2021 and all Hyundais from 2016 to 2021 lacked an immobilizer, an electronic security device which makes sure the correct key is inserted before starting the car (<a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/08/27/kia-hyundai-thefts-stolen-usb-immobilizer-tiktok"> Frank 2022</a>). This in combination with their steel key made Kias and Hyundais more seceptable to theft. Targetted auto theft of Kias and Hyundais began in early 2021 in Milwaukee where teenagers were exploiting the flawed design. A video was posted on TikTok by Markell Hughes on July 12, 2022 showing how a USB connector can be used to start one of these cars (<a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article263801328.html"> List 2022</a>). This video went viral gaining over 500,000 views and created the so called "Kia Challenge" (<a href="https://urbanmilwaukee.com/2022/06/29/kia-boyz-film-results-in-felony-charges/#google_vignette"> Jannene 2022</a> and <a href="[https://urbanmilwaukee.com/2022/06/29/kia-boyz-film-results-in-felony-charges/#google_vignette](https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/6/1/23742757/kia-hyundai-challenge-tiktok-instagram-youtube)"> Morrison 2023</a>). Hughes and others in Milwaukee were dubed the "Kia Boys" and Tom Gerszewski made a viral <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbTrLyqL_nw"> youtube video</a> about them in 2022. 

This challenge was far more dangerous than your average social media challenge. Theft of Kia and Hyundais more than tripled and criminals weren't substituting from other cars to the Korean branded cars. Total motor vehicle thefts jumped in July and remained higher than before for over a year. This is broken down by Kia and Hyundai thefts below (<a href="[https://urbanmilwaukee.com/2022/06/29/kia-boyz-film-results-in-felony-charges/#google_vignette](https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/6/1/23742757/kia-hyundai-challenge-tiktok-instagram-youtube)"> Morrison 2023</a>). In all the challenge resulted in a $200 million class-action settlement paid by Hyundai Motor Group, the owner Kia and Hyundai (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/18/business/kia-hyundai-settlement-car-thefts.html"> Medina 2023</a>).

While the "Kia Challenge" is unique in its criminal consequences, social media trends are a dime a dozen. My personal favorites are the water bottle fads which occur every year (I use these to teach changes in preferences to my students). Such challenges may change preferences and drive behaviors. The figure I include above show the 30-day rolling average of motor vehicle theft in Chicago. While Chicago is natorious for its crime, there is no reason to think a similar jump didn't occur in most metropolitian areas. If this figure were daily or monthly motor vehicle thefts, rather than over 30 days, I suspect there would be a discontinuoity in July. This would be enough exogeous variation to use a fuzzy regression discontinuity design. 

This was sort of a silly research idea I had, but there isn't an entirely clear outcome. The cleanest outcome is probably other types of crime. This could give information on which types of crime are subsitutes and compliments to motor vehicle theft which, while niche, remains unanswered. More importantly, I think the "Kia Challenge" unintenionally created by Hughes and the "Kia Boys" highlights that these common social media trends create exogenous variation which researchers can exploit in order to obtain causal inference. This is much in the same vein as <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20140012"> Melissa Kearney and Phillp Levine's paper</a> using variation in viewership of <em>16 and Pregnant</em>. The key is finding the right trend which can be used as an instrument to answer an important question.

On another note, why did the Hughes ever make the video in the first place? Presumably he could have continued extracting rents using this trick rather than alerting the whole world to what he was doing. However, the Milwaukee Police Department was on to these antics as they gave out free steering-wheel locks to Kia and Hyundai owners in February 2021 (<a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2021/06/10/3-months-7-000-citations-curb-milwaukees-reckless-driving/7599922002/?gnt-cfr=1&gca-cat=p&gca-uir=false&gca-epti=z11xx52u116852e007600v11xx52&gca-ft=223&gca-ds=sophi"> Robles 2021</a>).
