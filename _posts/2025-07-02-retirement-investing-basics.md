I taught my first class, Principles of Microeconomics, in Summer 2025. In the last two sessions of the course, I included a section on the basics of investing for retirement. I am passionate about financial literacy and education, and I shared some of what I have learned with my students to give them a baseline understanding. You can download this presentation <a href="/teaching/BasicsOfRetirementInvesting.pdf">here</a>.

Despite Florida requiring all high school students to take a personal finance class, many of my students didn't know what a stock was! They found this material both interesting and motivating for their own future.

My presentation assumes no prior knowledge of stocks, bonds, or investing. These notes are based on <a href="https://www.freefinancebook.com/more-stuff/about-the-author" target="_blank">Dr. Brent Evansâ€™s</a> textbook, available at <a href="https://www.freefinancebook.com/home">freefinancebook.com</a>, which I highly recommend for more detailed information than what I include. I share this in the hope that it will be helpful or inspiring to others, just as it was for my students and for me.
