One of my recent research ideas combined the identification strategy of Bayer, Hjalmarsson, and Pozen (2009) with the random peer assignment design in Lyle (2007). Bayer, Hjalmarsson, and Pozen show that exposure to peers who committed specific crimes increases a juvenile’s likelihood of committing those same crimes after release. I sought to extend their work by testing whether the severity of peers’ crimes further amplifies these effects.

I ultimately set the idea aside, but the identification strategy relied on peer exposure being independent of the individual prisoner. Peer composition is determined by the crimes and judicial processes of others, and it would only fail to be independent if an individual committed crimes with others who were later incarcerated in the same facility.

While Bayer, Hjalmarsson, and Pozen (2009) focus on knowledge transfer for specific crimes, peers may also influence broader outcomes by shaping salience, norms, and attitudes. This design would test whether exposure to peers with more severe convictions, measured by sentence length and felony class, increases the likelihood that ex-convicts escalate into more serious crimes than their prior offenses.
