One of my recent research ideas combines the identification strategy of Bayer, Hjalmarsson, and Pozen (2009) with the random assignment of "quality" of peers used in Lyle (2007). I hoped to build upon Bayer, Hjalmarsson, and Pozen (2009), who look at the effect of exposure to peers who committed specific crimes on a juveniles propensity to commit those specific crimes after release, to see if the severity of crime for which peers were sentenced for would strengthen the effects found in their paper.

I chose not to continue the idea, but the identification strategy was premissed on the exposure to peers is independent of the prisoner themself. This is because a prisoners peer composition is due to the crimes and criminal process of their peers and could only be related for individuals who committed crimes together.

It is possible that peers affect an individual's criminal patterns after release not just in sharing information for specific types of crime, such as in Bayer, Hjalmarsson, and Pozen (2009), but also in changing criminal salience, social norms, and crime attitudes. This design would test if peers with more severe convictions induce ex-convicts to recommit into more severe crimes than they were previously convicted of.
