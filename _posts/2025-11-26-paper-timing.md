The NBER is amazingly consistent with the release of their working paper series. They email out the list of new working papers every week at Monday at 12am in the morning, as I have yet to realize the epsilon chance world where I don't get this email as in <a href="https://arielrubinstein.tau.ac.il/papers/32.pdf">Rubenstein (1989)</a>. Unlike most people, firms, etc. the NBER's email continues just as strong and consistent throughout the holiday season. As we continue through this period of exorbinent amounts of food, football, and everyone's favorite, family, papers are still continually being released as new working papers or publications due to backlog, administrative delays, etc. Are these papers' circulation and citations, being hindered by their release date?

The NBER is aware of this sort of effect as they shifted their working papers emails away from alphabetical order to random order in 2014. Papers listed first in the email were later found to have about 30% more views, downloads, and citations (<a href="https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article-abstract/99/1/32/58370/It-s-Good-to-Be-First-Order-Bias-in-Reading-and">Feenberg et al 2017</a>). This well-known advantage of having an early-alphabet last-name motivated <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257%2Faer.20161492">Ray ⓡ Robson (2018)</a> to create the certified random order in which the authors randomly assign the order of their names themselves before circulation. This is evidence of the primacy effect's presence, even among economists, akin to <a href="https://www.econtheory.org/ojs/index.php/te/article/viewFile/20060003/444">Rubinstein and Salant (2006)</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755534513700514">Carlsson, Mørkbak, and Olsen (2012)</a>, and <a href="https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~rcarson/papers/OrderEffectsJEEM12.pdf">Day et al (2012)</a>.

Related to the primacy effect, I believe there may be an effect of a paper's release or publication date on its circulation and citations. Consider papers released during the holidays or during the summer break while academics are balancing a multitude of other resonsibilities and hobbies apart from work which they don't do during the traditional Fall and Spring semesters. In the case of the NBER email, this may result in it not being viewed for weeks until the individual is back on their normal schedule. At which point, they now have a handful of working paper emails to sort through all at once or never at all. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723001603">Lusher, Yang, and Carrell (2023)</a> provide evidence of crowding out among NBER working paper lists.

One may argue this effect to be ambiguous if you expect the decrease in papers released to be more than the decrease in attention that economists give them during the holidays and summer, but unfortunatelty the endogeneity of this question is
