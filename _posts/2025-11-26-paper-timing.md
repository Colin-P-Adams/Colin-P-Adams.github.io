The NBER is amazingly consistent with the release of their working paper series. They email out the list of new working papers every Monday at 12am in the morning, as I have yet to realize the epsilon chance world where I don't get this email as in <a href="https://arielrubinstein.tau.ac.il/papers/32.pdf">Rubenstein (1989)</a>. Unlike most people, firms, etc. the NBER's email continues just as strong and consistent throughout the holiday season. As we continue through this period of exorbinent amounts of food, football, and everyone's favorite, family, papers are still continually being released as new working papers or publications due to backlog, administrative delays, etc. Are these papers' circulation and citations being hindered by their release date?

The NBER is aware of this sort of systematic bias as they shifted their working paper emails away from alphabetical order to random order in 2014. Papers listed first in the email were later found to have about 30% more views, downloads, and citations (<a href="https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article-abstract/99/1/32/58370/It-s-Good-to-Be-First-Order-Bias-in-Reading-and">Feenberg et al 2017</a>). This well-known advantage of having an early-alphabet last-name motivated <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257%2Faer.20161492">Ray ⓡ Robson (2018)</a> to create the certified random order in which the authors randomly assign the order of their names themselves before circulation. This is evidence of the primacy effect's presence, even among economists, akin to <a href="https://www.econtheory.org/ojs/index.php/te/article/viewFile/20060003/444">Rubinstein and Salant (2006)</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755534513700514">Carlsson, Mørkbak, and Olsen (2012)</a>, and <a href="https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~rcarson/papers/OrderEffectsJEEM12.pdf">Day et al (2012)</a>.

Related to the primacy effect, I believe there may be an effect of a paper's release or publication date on its circulation and citations. Consider papers released during the holidays or during the Summer break while academics are balancing an increased amount of resonsibilities and hobbies compared to during the Fall and Spring semesters. In the case of NBER emails, this may result in not being viewed for weeks until the individual is back on their normal schedule. At which point, they now have a handful of working paper emails to sort through all at once or never at all. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723001603">Lusher, Yang, and Carrell (2023)</a> provide evidence of crowding out among NBER working paper lists.

It is possible for the effect to go the other direction if the decrease in papers released is more than the decrease in attention that economists give them during the holidays and Summer. Unfortunately this question is probably unanswerable for a few reasons (1) endogeneity from academics attempting to time their paper's release to coincide with more attention (I at least try to do this with my posts such as this one) (2) the complicated system and increasing lag between a paper being written and informally circulated, say at conferences, and it being published as a working or final paper such is documented in <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/341868">Ellison 2002</a> (3) papers should avoid being circulated as working papers prior to publication since that may increase their citations in a way that is correlated with the timing of publication itself, i.e. ommitted variable bias (<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13504851.2020.1855303">Wohlrabe and Bürgi 2020</a>).
