Delivery services such as DoorDash and Instacart, which have grown rapidly in the past decade especially with COVID, allow for a more precise labor and leisure tradeoff. Households no longer need to dedicate time to weekly grocery runs or interrupt what they are doing to prepare or pick up meals. These services let individuals reallocate time toward paid work or leisure activities when they value their time more than the delivery fee.

Food delivery has existed for decades in limited forms such as pizza or local chinese restaurants, but this changed with the launch of Postmates in 2011. For the first time, almost any restaurant could offer delivery without hiring dedicated drivers. DoorDash and UberEats soon followed. Instacart, founded in 2012, brought the same idea to groceries, again removing the need for stores to employ their own delivery staff. Since then, most major food delivery apps have expanded into grocery delivery, and many grocery stores now offer their own pickup systems. Grocery services typically charge a fee of about 5 percent.

What makes these services particularly interesting from an economic perspective is that they allow households to outsource one time tasks at low cost. Previously, outsourcing household labor usually required large fixed costs or repeated commitments. Examples include hiring a nanny, housekeeper, personal assistant, or landscaper. Grocery shopping falls into a category that is neither traditional work nor leisure, yet it must be done. Delivery services allow individuals to avoid this task once without needing to make an ongoing arrangement.

This creates a clearer and more continuous choice between labor and leisure. If a person values their time more than the effective cost of outsourcing the chore service fee plus tip then paying someone else becomes rational. And because many workers have fixed schedules, the time saved may not translate into additional paid work. Instead, it often becomes leisure time or time spent on other tasks that are not easily outsourced. This could be hobbies, childcare, exercise, or simply rest.

To make the numbers concrete, the average American household spends about 6,000 dollars per year on groceries (<a href="https://www.bls.gov/cex/tables.htm">BLS 2024</a>). Another measure is about 3,860 dollars per person (<a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-expenditure-series">USDA 2024</a>). Suppose a household makes one grocery trip per week and each trip takes about one hour from leaving home to returning. That is 52 hours per year which is more than an entire work week. Grocery delivery for the entire year may cost roughly 820 dollars about 300 dollars in service fees and about 520 dollars in tips if tipping 10 dollars each trip. This implies that if a person values their time above 15 dollars per hour, then paying for grocery delivery is economically sensible.

This also creates a basic arbitrage opportunity. Anyone earning at least 15 dollars per hour who can pick up even one extra hour of work per week could work instead of grocery shopping and come out ahead. For salaried workers who may not be able to increase hours, the benefit instead comes from gaining more leisure time which may be more valuable personally.

Delivery services are not perfect. Substitutions can be incorrect and there are personal preferences about selecting items such as produce. However, the broader point remains. These services allow households to bypass chores that fall in between work and leisure and in doing so they create a more precise choice over how time is spent.

Delivery is more than convenience. It changes how households allocate time and allows individuals to buy back small amounts of time on demand. That makes it an interesting development from the perspective of economic behavior.
