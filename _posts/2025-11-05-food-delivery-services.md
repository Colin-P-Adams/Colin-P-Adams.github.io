Delivery services, such as DoorDash and Instacart, which have become more common in the last decade, especially with COVID, allow for a more precise labor-leisure decision. Households no longer have to dedicate weekly time for their grocery store run or stop what they are doing to make or pick up food. These services allow individuals to increase time in formal labor (i.e. work/job) or leisure (i.e. hobbies) if they deem their time to be more valuable than the fee associated with delivery.

Food delivery for select restraunts (e.g., pizza and chinese) has been commonplace for decades, but Postmates's launch in 2011 changed the game allowing for all food establishments to deliver without hiring an employee. Other apps (e.g., DoorDash and UberEats) joined soon after Postmates. Instacart, founded in 2012, allows individuals to get groceries delivered to their door. This again allows for delivery without a designated hired employee from the grocery store. Since, many of the food delivery apps have expanded to groceries as well as stores adding their own pick up options. Grocery services charge a fee for service of about 5%. 

These services, especially grocery delivery, allow individuals to pay someone to do a one-off chore for them. Paying someone to do such chores previously had much higher up front costs and often could not be done only once keeping such services relegated to those much wealthier. For example, individuals having a live in nanny, assistant, housekeeper, or landscaper. Picking up groceries and prepared food falls along similar lines of being neither a traditional leisure nor labor. However, it must be done!

The ability for all individuals to pay someone to do a one-off chore for them, without expectation of doing it regularly or with high upfront costs, allows for individuals to more precisely choose between labor and leisure, one of the biggest questions in economics. If one's time is worth more than the 5% fee (plus tip) for groceries, then they should pay someone else to do it and continue working or spend more time on their favorite hobby. Given the fixed work schedule of many in the labor market, I believe most time saved from services like Instacart goes to hobbies or other chores which aren't as easily hired out.

To make this more concrete, the average American household spends about $6,000 in groceries a year (<a href="https://www.bls.gov/cex/tables.htm"> BLS 2024</a>). An alternative measure is an average of $3,860 per person (<a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-expenditure-series"> USDA 2024</a>). Consider an average American household where one individual goes to the store once a week. A trip to the store (from door to door) may take an hour on average. Such a household spends 52 hours a year going to the store alone. Thats more than an average work week! This household could avoid going to the store all year for only $820 ($300 in 5% fees and a generous $10 tip per trip). This makes the tradeoff easy. If your time is worth more than $15 per hour, then you should pay someone to go to the store! Your time would be better spent working or on your favorite hobby.

Interestingly, this gives a clear arbitrage opportunity for anyone working an hourly job, with pay of at least $15, who can pick up extra hours. One could work in place of going to the grocery store and come out ahead. Better yet, and more applicable for nonhourly workers, you have more time for leisure. 

While I am admittedly simplifying this process (e.g., shoppers often find improper substitutes) delivery services make for a more precise labor-leisure tradeoff by removing the requirement of such chores which are neither purely labor nor leisure. Additionally, hourly workers may arbitrage by working rather than going to the grocery store and salaried workers take advantage by spending more time on leisure.
