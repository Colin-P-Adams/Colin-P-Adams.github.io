Delivery services, such as DoorDash and Instacart, which have become more common in the last decade, especially with COVID, allow for a more precise labor-leisure decision. Households no longer have to dedicate weekly time for their grocery store run or stop what they are doing to make or pick up food. These services allow individuals to increase time in formal labor (i.e. work/job) or leisure (i.e. hobbies) if they deem their time to be more valuable than the fee associated with delivery.

Food delivery for select restraunts (e.g., pizza and chinese) has been commonplace for decades, but Postmates's launch in 2011 changed the game allowing for all food establishments to delivery without hiring an employee. Other apps (e.g., DoorDash and UberEats) joined soon after Postmates. Instacart, founded in 2012, allows individuals to get groceries delivered to their door. This again allows for delivery without a designated hired employee from the grocery store. Since, mnay of the food delivery apps have expanded to groceries as well as stores adding their own pick up options. Grocery services charge a fee for service of about 5%.
