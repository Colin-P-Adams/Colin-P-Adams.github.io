I taught my first class, Principles of Microeconomics, in Summer 2025. In the last two classes of that course I taught a section on the basics of investing for retirement. I am passionate about financial literacy and education and shared some of what I have learned with my students to give them a baseline knowledge. Despite Florida requiring all high school students to take a personal finance class, many didn't know what a stock was! My students found this material both interesting and motivating for their own retirement investing. 

These notes are primarily based off of <a href="https://www.freefinancebook.com/more-stuff/about-the-author" target="_blank">Dr. Brent Evans's</a> textbook,  <a href="https://www.freefinancebook.com/home">freefinancebook.com</a> (which I highly recommend for more information than what I include in my presentation slides). I include my presentation, which assumes you know nothing about stocks, bonds, or investing, in the hopes that it may be helpful or provide motivation for others as it did myself and my students.
