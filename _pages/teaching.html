    He's great! I calculated the opportunity cost of taking this class, and it turns out there wasn’t a better option!

    “He taught very well and explained things very clearly, not trying to rush through the curriculum but instead making sure everyone would understand what we were learning. One of the best instructors I've had at FSU.”

    “Very accessible and has had great office hour chats with me, and follows up with emails pertaining to our conversation topics which pushes me to chase my goals further. Additionally, he effectively connects with us through personal anecdotes and his interests, bringing up relatable stories that invite humor into the space. Lastly, he can explain the material in layman terms, mathematically, and conceptually which absolutely stimulates my interest for everything economics; I'm concentrating in economics because of this course!”

    “Honestly, he taught perfectly for me. He also had some engaging exercises that were used as examples on how things worked, which I thought was very interesting. There's nothing he could've done more. Provided everything needed and more to pass the class.”
