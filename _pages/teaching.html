    “He taught very well and explained things very clearly—not trying to rush through the curriculum, but instead making sure everyone understood what we were learning. One of the best instructors I've had at FSU.”

    “Very accessible and had great office hour chats with me. He followed up with emails about our conversations, which pushed me to chase my goals further. He also connected with us through personal anecdotes and interests, bringing relatable and humorous stories into class. Lastly, he explained the material in layman’s terms, mathematically, and conceptually—this absolutely stimulated my interest in economics. I'm concentrating in economics because of this course!”

    “Honestly, he taught perfectly for me. He also had some engaging exercises that demonstrated how things worked, which I thought were very interesting. There’s nothing he could've done more. He provided everything needed—and more—to pass the class.”
