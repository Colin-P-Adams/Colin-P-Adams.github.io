    I exploit exogenous variation in kindergarten entry cutoff dates based on date of birth and use administrative prison data with a regression discontinuity design (RDD) to measure their effects on adult crime. Kindergarten entry cutoffs create quasi-random variation in school starting age. Children born just after the cutoff are required to delay entry by a year, which reduces their required schooling because compulsory schooling laws are age based and changes their peer interactions. I draw on data from Florida and Illinois, two states that gradually moved their kindergarten eligibility cutoff dates earlier by one month each year during the 1980s. Leveraging temporal variation in school entry cutoffs in Florida and Illinois, I link school start age to incarceration outcomes observed decades later and find that delayed entry increases crime among females at least 16%, with this effect concentrated among White women.

    Using data from 1994 to 2017, we consider characteristics that affect quarterback (QB) development in the National Football League. Our analysis leads to three key findings. Firstly, we show that a young QB’s career is worsened when he plays alongside a Pro Bowl QB. Secondly, we find that QB’s career outcomes are better when they are drafted by a bad team. Finally, we investigate the role of rookie playing time and find evidence that playing as a rookie reduces career outcomes. In all three cases, the effects are largest in the latter portion of a QB’s career.
