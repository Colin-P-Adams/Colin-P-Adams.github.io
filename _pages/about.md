<section id="about-me">
  <p>
    I am a second-year Ph.D. student in economics and Charles and a Persis Rockwood Fellow at Florida State University. I expect to graduate from FSU in May 2028.
    My research interests are in crime, public, and applied economics with a particular interest in the causes of recidivism in the US.
